# PA1
CSC 2301, programming assignment 1 (PA1)

1.  You are given a piece of code PA1-1.s that computes the equation *6x – 7*, where *x* is some integer value.  You need to modify the code to make it compute the equation *2x^2 – 5x + 3*.  The answer should be in R3 once the program finishes.  You should try various values for *x* and check your results on a calculator to make sure the program is working correctly.
2.  You are given some starter code in PA1-2.s.  You are to do the following.
    * Call scanf to read a single integer from the user.  A scanf format string is provided for you in *in*.  See the comments in the code for what you need to do.
    * Then compute the following: *2x* -> R2, *3x* -> R3, *4x* -> R4, *5x* -> R5, and *6x* -> R6.  Make sure the value for *x* remains in R1.  You should use MOV and MUL instructions to compute these values. 
    * The rest of the code will print out all these values that you computed.  __Don't modify this part of the code.__
