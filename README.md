# PA1
CSC 2301, programming assignment 1 (PA1)

1.  You are given a piece of code PA1-1.s that computes the equation *6x – 7*, where *x* is some integer value.  You need to modify the code to make it compute the equation *2x^2 – 5x + 3*.  The answer should be in R3 once the program finishes.  You should try various values for *x* and check your results on a calculator to make sure the program is working correctly.
2.  You are given some starter code in PA1-2.s.  You are to do the following.
    * Call scanf to read a single integer from the user.  A scanf format string is provided for you in *in*.  See the comments in the code for what you need to do.
    * Then compute the following: *2x* -> R2, *3x* -> R3, *4x* -> R4, *5x* -> R5, and *6x* -> R6.  Make sure the value for *x* remains in R1.  You should use MOV and MUL instructions to compute these values. 
    * The rest of the code will print out all these values that you computed.  __Don't modify this part of the code.__

## Grading Rubric

### Comments
Your code must contain (in comments)
 * Name of author (or both partners for pair assignments)
 * Name of assignment
 * Date assignment is completed
 * A short (one or two line) description of what your program does.
 * A description of how each register in the program is being used
 * When subroutines are created, a description of all inputs and the purpose of the function
 * Any outside resources (other than textbook, or slides) utilized in the completion of the project
 * __Each line of new code you write should indicate what that line of code is doing.__

### Grading standard

| Standard | Correctness | Design and Efficiency | Comments and format |
|----------|-------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
|Full credit|Program fully implements the operational requirements as set forth in the assignment.  For all test inputs, the program produces the correct result.: 20 points | Code implements the algorithm in the most efficient manner possible: 5 points | Code contains all the  comments listed above: 5 points |
| Good | Program produces the correct result in 75% of the test cases: 15 points | Code does two or three operations that are not needed, or could be simplified: 3 points | 1 or 2 items missing or code not neat: 3 points |
| Fair | Program produces the correct result in 50% of the test cases: 10 points | Code does many inefficient operations, but is generally able to be followed:  2 points | about half of comments are missing: 2 points |
| Poor | Program produces the correct result in less than 50% of the test cases, but a reasonable attempt has been made to write correct code: 5 points | | Minimal commenting: 1 point |
| Nothing | Code not turned in or does not appear to address the operational requirements in any meaningful way: 0 | Code is very inefficient or convoluted or difficult to follow: 0 | No commenting: 0 |
